# User Microservice
## Monolith decomposition into microservices
This project is part of the Graduation Project in Computer Science (PGC) at UFABC.
The work is a case study on decomposing a monolithic application into a microservices architecture.

As the practical outcome, the project delivers a prototype of the User microservice, 
which represents one of the decomposed domains from the original monolithic application.

## Project Setup

**Java version:** `17.0.6-tem`

### Sdkman
The service was done using a MacOs system. 
To select Java version, `sdkman` was used. \
[Sdkman installation guide](https://sdkman.io/install/)
